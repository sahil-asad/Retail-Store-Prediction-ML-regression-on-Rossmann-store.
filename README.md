# Retail Store Prediction on Rossmann Store (Regression)
## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for daily sales across 1,115 Rossmann stores in Europe.

## Objective
To optimize sales predictions and contribute to improved decision-making for store management by enabling better resource allocation and sales strategies.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on daily sales, store features, and external factors like deals, proximity, holidays, and seasonality.

## Data Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to gain insights into the data and understand the relationship between sales and various factors.
### Regression Techniques:
Applied advanced regression techniques, including linear regression, elastic net, random forest, and AdaBoost, to optimize sales predictions.
## Model Performance
Achieved 98% accuracy with Xgboost, demonstrating the effectiveness of the predictive model.
## Results
Leveraged factors such as deals, proximity, holidays, and seasonality for enhanced forecasting of daily sales.
Contributed to improved decision-making for store management by providing accurate sales predictions.
## Future Work
Further refinement of the predictive model to improve accuracy and robustness.
Integration of additional features or external data sources for better predictions.
